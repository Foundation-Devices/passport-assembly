# Passport Electronics

This repository contains the full production assembly for Passport, an open source Bitcoin hardware wallet made by Foundation Devices.

## Project Structure
Passport consists of the following components:
- Mechanical files
- Electrical files
- Firmware

**Mechanical files** contains the custom plastic and metal components, as well as stock parts like screws and labels.

**Electrical files** contains the printed circuit board assemblies.

**Firmware** contains the software that runs on Passport.
